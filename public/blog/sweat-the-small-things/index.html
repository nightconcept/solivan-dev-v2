Jesse also pointed out the problems of PaperMod and how many missing features there are. PaperModX attempts to address these lack of features, but it does not get much maintenance due to the author of PaperModX’s commitments to other projects. This leaves PaperMod(X) users fragmented. Unfortunately, I am stuck between which to use and I want my core job here to be blogging, not how to maintain my blog’s codebase. I switched from a self-built platform so that I could be free of that and rely on libraries maintained by others.\nI think through all my previous thoughts about blogs and how I interact with them, I want to try playing around with more static site generators. I should diversify what off-the-shelf SSG I use. The next question though is how interoperable are my markdown files between the different SSGs? How much will I have to modify the frontmatter of each Markdown file to make it work? I guess that’s the next thing to sweat over.\nSo what is the moral of the story? Well, it was that at each step of the way I learned a little. Sure, I was stressed trying to find the answer to each question that came up, but at the end of it, I grew just a little bit.
