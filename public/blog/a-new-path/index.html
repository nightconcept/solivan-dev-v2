The election season is over so now I do not have to “care” as much. I can’t do anything until the next cycle. So here’s what’s changing:\nI have a family who needs me to be present with them. My family deserves my energy and not the incoming toxic cycle of news that will inevitably flood all news sites. I do not regularly view The New York Times and The Hill anymore, but I definitely will not during the next four years. I will be focused on viewing only local news that affects my life. I am fortunate to live in a blue state that lines up with most of my ideals so I will generally be shielded from crazy-goings-ons of DC. I will be removing the Reddit front page from most of my browsing. It wastes time. I have other hobbies I want to do. This is a good opportunity to get on that. I will read more instead of aimlessly browsing my phone. My phone is just for communication. I will not actively seek news, but if someone tells me about it, I can look it up. I will not seek out opportunities to get fed news to make the excuse I need to look it up. This is meant to allow me to look at things that happen that are truly relevant to me. I will make less jokes about certain individuals I despise. It’s not worth it anymore to say anything. It doesn’t get me anywhere. It doesn’t make me happy. That said, I do need to find an outlet for this anger. I can’t bottle it up inside. All in all, I want to take these next four years as a chance to grow and do something productive for me. I will not wallow in loss.\n",
