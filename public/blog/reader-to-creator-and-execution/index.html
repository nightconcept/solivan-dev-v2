This is my continuous output for thoughts and ideas I have. This is why I am calling it TaaIP or Twitter as an Idea Platform. I am using Twitter (not the other way around) as a way to refine and sharpen my ideas. I have taken the idea from Austin Kleon’s book “Steal Like an Artist” to follow 9 people (and 3 from each one) on Twitter and listen to their ideas and points of views.\nI am really focusing on reading diverse sets of ideas (I briefly followed a transphobic person and subsequently “improved” my view of thinking on whether trans people should be allowed to compete in sports of their chosen gender. My view is simply: let them compete, we need more data to determine “fairness” in the future, whatever that may entail.) to draw from. I do not want to be that person who lives in a liberal echo chamber.\nOne of the mantras of Stoicism is:\nDon’t put on airs about your self-improvement\nEpictetus I very much intend to stick to that.
