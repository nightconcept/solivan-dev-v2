      <title>A New Path</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/a-new-path/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, the election happened. Ignoring policy differences, I think my biggest grievance is we chose an angry, immature man to run the most powerful country in the world. I do not want to be in a world where this is OK especially for my children. We should be able to respectfully disagree with each other and move on. However, the ballots showed that as long as he delivers the economy this is OK. Sorry, but I can&amp;rsquo;t accept creating a toxic workplace in exchange for supposed gains for people. I have a high level of certainty that my family and I will be fine, but I do worry for those around us who are not as fortunate. I will be living in a community with those who may not be as fortunate and if they are pushed down, well my quality of life will suffer. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important to take care of everyone around us. A rising tide raises all boats as they say.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ergonomic Keyboards Pt1</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started work as a software engineer about 7 months ago now. With many long hours sitting and staring at the screen, I realized that my hands and arms were hurting. I also noticed my eyes were hurting, but I resolved that by being more dedicated to following my &lt;a href=&#34;https://hovancik.net/stretchly/&#34;&gt;Stretchly&lt;/a&gt; routines (every 20 minutes, start at something 20 ft away for 20 seconds and every hour, take a 2 minute walk). I started researching into keyboards to see if they would help me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Migrating to Hugo</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/migrating-to-hugo/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 15:12:47 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/migrating-to-hugo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first post using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator, with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod&#34;&gt;PaperMod&lt;/a&gt; theme. I migrated from a self-built &lt;a href=&#34;https://kit.svelte.dev/&#34;&gt;Svelte-Kit&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href=&#34;https://jamstack.com/&#34;&gt;JAMStack&lt;/a&gt;. This gave me an opportunity to use a simpler to manage stack of getting content out there. I got to dip my toes into the world of a front-end web developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-switch&#34;&gt;Why did I switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly learned front-end is not for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an eye for colors and style. The result was a not-very beautiful layout compared to some of my inpsirations. What I really cared more about was creating &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;. I think the level of extra maintenance with a self-built platform (we can ignore how much there actually was) was just enough friction to get me not writing. I also had to hand create every Markdown file and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much energy/interest to get that automated and running.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gamedev Log October 2023</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/gamedev-log-october-2023/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/gamedev-log-october-2023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;October was a fairly sparse month for game development. I got a little burned out of aimlessly coding. I was working on breakout in pygame using an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system&#34;&gt;Entity-Component-System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started work as a software engineer which has really consumed a lot of my programming energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started doing game development again this month. I have chosen to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://pyga.me/&#34;&gt;pygame-ce&lt;/a&gt; as my framework so that I can work in Python. When I last started in 2020, I had chosen the &lt;a href=&#34;https://love2d.org/&#34;&gt;Love2D&lt;/a&gt; framework which used Lua as the programming language. My original thoughts were that I gave up on gamedev because I was working in a language that would never be used outside of programming. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough in Lua itself to keep me fully interested in it, so I abandoned it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/video-encoding-for-people-in-a-hurry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This a quick &lt;em&gt;opinionated&lt;/em&gt; guide towards encoding your videos for your data hoarding habits. &lt;a href=&#34;https://handbrake.fr/&#34;&gt;HandBrake&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source tool that is widely used by many to convert videos. It is available on Windows/macOS/Linux, so chances are you can use it. HandBrake itself is mostly an easy to use GUI that call various audio and video codecs so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn how to use those individual (mostly command-line) tools. This is an article for people in a hurry so let&amp;rsquo;s get going!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Made This Site (2023 Edition)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite how long this site has been up, I actually started in March 2023. This is not an explicit tutorial, but you could probably follow along and get through building your own similar site if you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal of this guide is to give you the exact steps on how to build this site. My goal is to explain a little bit about what I know of the web (which I am not an expert by a longshot) and the design decisions I made to build this in 2023. If you want step-by-step guides, here are some that I used or referred to:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Legitimacy of the Supreme Court</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/legitimacy-of-the-supreme-court/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/legitimacy-of-the-supreme-court/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the Supreme Court. I got to see the building last fall. I have read &amp;ldquo;The Nine&amp;rdquo; by Jeffrey Toobin. As a liberal, I love RBG. I love the little snippets of quip and oration from the Justices and the lawyers who need to argue before them. I am not a lawyer, but maybe in another universe, I could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I do not love: the downfall of the past few years. With the latest revelation that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/25/1088720571/ginni-thomas-tex-messages-mark-meadows-2020-election&#34;&gt;Ginni Thomas texted Mark Meadows to overturn the election&lt;/a&gt;, this has really soured the rest of it. Of course I already knew that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/is-ginni-thomas-a-threat-to-the-supreme-court&#34;&gt;she was already a threat&lt;/a&gt; in some way, but now this just confirms it. Aside from this current &amp;ldquo;scandal,&amp;rdquo; let&amp;rsquo;s go back to see the latest few Supreme Court picks:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reader to Creator and Execution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep talking and thinking about how I can reach a creator state. It turns out, I am the biggest blocker for reaching that creator state (no surprises there). Self-doubt, imposter syndrome, a fear of putting myself out there are all reasons I have been afraid to push more content. Does anyone care? &lt;em&gt;Who cares?&lt;/em&gt; I am doing this for me. To push myself beyond what I am comfortable and capable of right now. This is my journey of self improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 20 of 2021</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/top-20-of-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/top-20-of-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are my top 20 things (besides my wife and buns of course) from 2021. This list is by no means perfect or comprehensive and in no particular order, but things that managed to make it past all the self-filtering at this point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccines -&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously, we cannot talk about 2021 without talking about the elephant in the room, COVID-19. After a year of saying &amp;ldquo;after everything that&amp;rsquo;s happened,&amp;rdquo; we (as humans) can now give a giant screw you to COVID. The development of this vaccine is probably one of the greatest achievements I may see in my lifetime. Using a new technology, we were able to create, test, certify, and begin deployment in just about 8 months from (what I perceive) as the start of the pandemic. Kudos to the scientists, researchers, medical staff, etc. who made this all possible. Let it be known that you will go down in history as someone who saved millions, maybe billions, of lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obsidian.md&lt;/strong&gt; - This tool has been amazing for me. It&amp;rsquo;s a way of managing all of your knowledge and notes sort of like Wikipedia with all those links between ideas. It&amp;rsquo;s a free alternative to something like Roam Research which is $15 a month for multiple users. Obsidian also functions as my daily journal where I can write my thoughts. I migrated away from using Notion.so which also functioned similarly to a Wiki except it is cloud based. The pro (at least for me, maybe not for others) is that Obsidian is a local folder populated by Markdown (slightly formatted text files) files that I sync via Google Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spiderman: No Way Home&lt;/strong&gt; - I would say this is the best movie of 2021. Sure, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of choices (Matrix Resurrections was not good and while Dune was great, it suffers from being a 2 parter which I have to wait until 2023 for) and it may get a boost from recency bias, but nonetheless it is one of the few movies I would recommend almost everyone see if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen any Spider-man or Marvel movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dune (the board game)&lt;/strong&gt; - I recently had watched Dune so I was excited to see the flavor of this board game. It&amp;rsquo;s a re-implementation of one of my favorite board games of all time, Rex: Final Days of an Empire by Fantasy Flight Games, which is actually a reimplementation of the never reprinted 1970s game of Dune. Our game session was so fun the first time around, we played a second round right after wee in the late night. I am definitely bringing this out again for my next board game session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture by David Kushner -&lt;/strong&gt; This book got me to play and beat Doom. I had never liked Doom as a kid because I was really sensitive to violence, my parents banned me from it due to its violence, and I am just generally anxious playing single player games that make me feel alone. However, the narrative of the development of Doom was so enticing I just had to play it. This will probably be the last game ever developed in this perfect storm of bro-culture, a very small development team, and limited deployment schemes. The book was a fantastic listen in the car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens&lt;/strong&gt; - I started it in 2021 and was hooked in that year so this totally counts. This book hit the top of the NY Times Bestseller list in 2018 and I have just got around to it. I actually got this as an audiobook at first, but returned it after I realized I have a lot of difficulty listening to fiction in the car and especially when the reader has an accent (relative to me). I bought a paper copy months later on a whim and was not immediately hooked. It honestly took me 30-40 pages before I started caring for the main character, Kya, and the setting. Once the rising action started happening, I read multiple times a day (I read often, but in very short bursts of 15-20 minutes) just to get through this faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams by Matthew Walker&lt;/strong&gt; - This book got me really focused on trying to sleep better. As I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten older, I&amp;rsquo;ve really come to value sleep. However, this book put in my face the effects of not getting enough sleep. This book truly changed how I view sleep and how I actively try to make sure I get that 7-8 hours of sleep every single night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art by James Nestor -&lt;/strong&gt; Also another book that has changed my life. I am a former mouth breather because of this book. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a reason to breathe through my nose unless I needed to smell something. This book made me switch to nose breathing due to the overhwhelming number of benefits for longevity and health. To be honest, I cannot remember the exact details of the benefits, but despite that, I do actively focus on retraining my body to breathe through my nose (except in smelly situations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/strong&gt; - This will be polarizing for some people, but at least for my group of friends we sunk 20 hours into the beta and 60 hours into the main game. That was a lot. This game was so much fun for me, I want to play it right this second, but I have to wait for people to pick it back up again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting married -&lt;/strong&gt; The whole seesaw in August regarding masking mandates kept us reeling back and forth. However, after all was said and done, the wedding was absolutely dope. Only pictures can do it justice. I&amp;rsquo;ll just drop the album &lt;a href=&#34;https://karinamaksphotography.pic-time.com/CuiSM&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.karinamaks.com/&#34;&gt;Karina &amp;amp; Maks Photography&lt;/a&gt; for shooting them BTW) before actually revealing the link to anyone else. Thank you to everyone who helped make it amazing and of course to my amazing wife Kim. Everyone said it was amazing in every single way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My bachelor party&lt;/strong&gt; - This was just amazing. We discovered nerf. We played lots of MTG. We drank lots. We played lots of games. Michael did a great job organizing it. Thank you to all who came in and made it a great time. This was also one of the last experiences I had with Harris who passed this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work&lt;/strong&gt; - This is kind of a weird one, but I&amp;rsquo;m going with it. My workplace has been amazing for dealing with this crisis and giving me a reasonable wage increases in light of inflation and for recognition of my talent and value. All the stories I hear of every other workplace, sound honestly really awful. As a current MBA student, I just can&amp;rsquo;t believe some of the decisions made when your workplace is hemorrhaging people. While my job isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly stimulating every day, I am satisfied with the work I do combined with the stability it provides me and my family. In the years where workplaces have shown dislike for their workers, mine has embraced their workers and I truly appreciate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motion sensing trash can&lt;/strong&gt; - I use it literally every day. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t rock like the old foot pedal one when it opened. It can also sit away from the wall where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t scratch it up. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; expensive, but it has affected my day-to-day life to a benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecobee smart thermostat&lt;/strong&gt; - This has lowered my electricity bill by ~15% per month plus a $25 credit for participating in high-energy demand savings times. It also heats up based on motion sensing by room. It will probably pay off itself in by March (just after 1 year) and then I will be in net savings from it (and helping the environment!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 inch skillet&lt;/strong&gt; - We already have an 11 inch pan and a wok. Getting an 8 inch skillet is the perfect size for haemul pajeon (seafood scallion pancakes) from H-Mart and oyakodon (chicken &amp;amp; egg bowls). With this last piece, I think our kitchenware needs are all fulfilled and complete!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheel of Time, Season 1&lt;/strong&gt; - Despite the lukewarm reviews, I quite enjoyed the show. Some of the changes made from the book to the show do not get in the way and actually improve from what little I know of the source material. I have enjoyed a fill of fantasy after Game of Thrones miserably ended a few years ago. I really do hope this series continues on somewhat deep into the books. I can&amp;rsquo;t see actors/actresses sticking around for 14 books worth of TV show. Although, that would be &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; if it did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Witcher, Season 2&lt;/strong&gt; - Again, another show filling that fantasy gap. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe the first season came out at the end of 2019 before the pandemic. It&amp;rsquo;s finally back and the series kept a much better pace this time. This may be due to the fact that the source material is now the main story arc rather than a collection of side stories which is what season 1 covered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wandavision&lt;/strong&gt; - I just had zero idea what to expect out of this show. The trailer was pretty jarring (remember the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj9J2ecsSpo&#34;&gt;black and white trailer&lt;/a&gt;?) when it first came out. After watching the series to completion, wow it really showed the depth of both characters absent from the movies. The show also showed us the impact that the D+ MCU shows could/will have on the overall movies. I think the D+ shows will be a great complement to the movies as we are still hooked (even after some fatigue and actually skipping Eternals in theaters) on the whole MCU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/strong&gt; - Honestly, I am a Hawkeye fan. Not like super hardcore, but I always root for him to make an impact in every scene he is in. I think overall he is underappreciated because his skills are dramatically glossed over. He just shoot bow good. Sometimes sword good. Thor BTW is a demigod. Hard to look good when Hawkeyes only outings were the Avengers movies (Jeremy Renner&amp;rsquo;s cameo in Thor 1 does not count and let&amp;rsquo;s face it, Civil War was Avengers 1.5) and outshined by literally everyone. His only comparison was Scarlett Johannson&amp;rsquo;s Black Widow who had about the same set of skills minus, but she&amp;rsquo;s hot. Anyways, I was a fan of the Matt Fraction run of Hawkeye comics (the only collection of comics actually in my posession to survive the many book purges) which this show draws a lot of inspiration from. Seeing the art style combined with the many nods in writing just felt like my long term investment (I got the volumes in 2014 IIRC) finally paid off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/strong&gt; - Dropping convtroverial pick for the last one hah. He is not the progressive idol I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have as our next president (healthcare, marijuana, student loans please?). He is however a whole hell of a lot more stable than our last president (yes DJT was still our president). As of this date, his approvals are low, but let&amp;rsquo;s face it: we are not mired in a controversy and drama every single day. The controversies I can just count on my hand:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neera Tanden where she called Mitch McConnell &amp;ldquo;Voldemort,&amp;rdquo; Susan Collins &amp;ldquo;The Worst,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CDC reduced the quarantine window down to 5 days. This was just really strange overall and I know it made the medical community really mad about their saftey. I just think it&amp;rsquo;s plain stupid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not completing Build Back Better Act by Christmas. This one is only partly his fault as he was not able to smooth it all and is not the only player for this game, but just like all things in politics, progress is slow and it eventually will get there in some form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Afghanistan pull out process I think could have been a little bit better planned with us getting out all our people in a timely and reasonable fashion. Overall, it was going to be chaos, but for the most part we got almost everyone out (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-11-26/explainer-what-happened-to-the-afghanistan-evacuation&#34;&gt;124,000 through the 6 weeks leading up to the deadline with less than 200 Americans remaining as of November 26th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​ Overall, Joe Biden has kept my politics mental health in line. He hasn&amp;rsquo;t wowed me (yet, maybe ever, who knows) but at least I am not going crazy every day with something stupid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;DO YouR OwN resEarCH&amp;rdquo; as they say since the start of the pandemic. I have been. My #1 source for all COVID-19 related news has been from The New York Times. I remember throughout the early pandemic, I was doing research all day while I worked from home. I was learning all sorts of things about epidemiology, viruses, pandemics, you name it. It felt &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; to be learning all this stuff. I was in school for MBA, but things are totally different when you are learning for &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tweets Collected Part 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am going to start a collection of what would be Tweets or Twitlongers. All of these will be thoughts too poorly thought out to be it&amp;rsquo;s own post, but too long to be a tweet. Every numbered section would have been a its own Tweet or Twitlonger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: I think I have something against Twitter. I use it to semi-promote this blog to a very small audience. 18 followers as of this writing. I deleted all my tweets recently due to privacy concerns. I jumped back only for this blog. I installed the app and I started following people. I would say these are some Twitter intellectuals. One of them has a blog that got me inspired to start my own. I started down a dark path of comparison. Wrong. I violated the goal of being myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a few different goals with this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-improve-my-writing-skills-realistic&#34;&gt;1. Improve my writing skills. (Realistic)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the number one goal. How am I doing this? By writing &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. This post will come up just one day after my intro post. I don&amp;rsquo;t have plans to necessarily write everyday, but I will ride whatever wave comes my way. For now, I think every day is sustainable as I am currently on winter break from my MBA classes at West Texas A&amp;amp;M University.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is This?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the purpose of this website? The combination of the URL &amp;amp; blog name, the sidebar description and this nobody writer all reveal nothing about what this place is. I think the best way to summarize really what this site is: this website is a personal blog which can vary from some common topics that I think about like politics and video games (development sometimes!) to macroeconomics and marriage all in the pursuit of &amp;ldquo;developing&amp;rdquo; better writing. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what I am going to talk about on each given post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
