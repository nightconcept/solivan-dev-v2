    <p>So, the election happened. Ignoring policy differences, I think my biggest grievance is we chose an angry, immature man to run the most powerful country in the world. I do not want to be in a world where this is OK especially for my children. We should be able to respectfully disagree with each other and move on. However, the ballots showed that as long as he delivers the economy this is OK. Sorry, but I can’t accept creating a toxic workplace in exchange for supposed gains for people. I have a high level of certainty that my family and I will be fine, but I do worry for those around us who are not as fortunate. I will be living in a community with those who may not be as fortunate and if they are pushed down, well my quality of life will suffer. It is important to take care of everyone around us. A rising tide raises all boats as they say.

    <p>Ergonomic Keyboards, Part 1 The Problem I started work as a software engineer about 7 months ago now. With many long hours sitting and staring at the screen, I realized that my hands and arms were hurting. I also noticed my eyes were hurting, but I resolved that by being more dedicated to following my Stretchly routines (every 20 minutes, start at something 20 ft away for 20 seconds and every hour, take a 2 minute walk). I started researching into keyboards to see if they would help me.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This is my first post using Hugo, a static site generator, with the PaperMod theme. I migrated from a self-built Svelte-Kit based JAMStack. This gave me an opportunity to use a simpler to manage stack of getting content out there. I got to dip my toes into the world of a front-end web developer.
Why did I switch? I quickly learned front-end is not for me. I don’t have an eye for colors and style. The result was a not-very beautiful layout compared to some of my inpsirations. What I really cared more about was creating content. I think the level of extra maintenance with a self-built platform (we can ignore how much there actually was) was just enough friction to get me not writing. I also had to hand create every Markdown file and I didn’t have much energy/interest to get that automated and running.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>October was a fairly sparse month for game development. I got a little burned out of aimlessly coding. I was working on breakout in pygame using an Entity-Component-System.
I started work as a software engineer which has really consumed a lot of my programming energy.
I started doing game development again this month. I have chosen to use pygame-ce as my framework so that I can work in Python. When I last started in 2020, I had chosen the Love2D framework which used Lua as the programming language. My original thoughts were that I gave up on gamedev because I was working in a language that would never be used outside of programming. There wasn’t enough in Lua itself to keep me fully interested in it, so I abandoned it.

    <p>This a quick opinionated guide towards encoding your videos for your data hoarding habits. HandBrake is an open-source tool that is widely used by many to convert videos. It is available on Windows/macOS/Linux, so chances are you can use it. HandBrake itself is mostly an easy to use GUI that call various audio and video codecs so you don’t have to learn how to use those individual (mostly command-line) tools.

My goal of this guide is to give you the exact steps on how to build this site. My goal is to explain a little bit about what I know of the web (which I am not an expert by a longshot) and the design decisions I made to build this in 2023.

    <p>I love the Supreme Court. I got to see the building last fall. I have read “The Nine” by Jeffrey Toobin. As a liberal, I love RBG. I love the little snippets of quip and oration from the Justices and the lawyers who need to argue before them. I am not a lawyer, but maybe in another universe, I could have been.
Things I do not love: the downfall of the past few years. With the latest revelation that Ginni Thomas texted Mark Meadows to overturn the election, this has really soured the rest of it. Of course I already knew that she was already a threat in some way, but now this just confirms it. Aside from this current “scandal,” let’s go back to see the latest few Supreme Court picks:
