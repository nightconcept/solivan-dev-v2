      <description>October was a fairly sparse month for game development. I got a little burned out of aimlessly coding. I was working on breakout in pygame using an Entity-Component-System.
I started work as a software engineer which has really consumed a lot of my programming energy.
I started doing game development again this month. I have chosen to use pygame-ce as my framework so that I can work in Python. When I last started in 2020, I had chosen the Love2D framework which used Lua as the programming language.</description>

      <description>I started doing game development again this month. I have chosen to use pygame-ce as my framework so that I can work in Python. When I last started in 2020, I had chosen the Love2D framework which used Lua as the programming language. My original thoughts were that I gave up on gamedev because I was working in a language that would never be used outside of programming. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough in Lua itself to keep me fully interested in it, so I abandoned it.</description>
