      <description>&lt;p&gt;October was a fairly sparse month for game development. I got a little burned out of aimlessly coding. I was working on breakout in pygame using an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system&#34;&gt;Entity-Component-System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started work as a software engineer which has really consumed a lot of my programming energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started doing game development again this month. I have chosen to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://pyga.me/&#34;&gt;pygame-ce&lt;/a&gt; as my framework so that I can work in Python. When I last started in 2020, I had chosen the &lt;a href=&#34;https://love2d.org/&#34;&gt;Love2D&lt;/a&gt; framework which used Lua as the programming language. My original thoughts were that I gave up on gamedev because I was working in a language that would never be used outside of programming. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough in Lua itself to keep me fully interested in it, so I abandoned it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
