      <description>Ergonomic Keyboards, Part 1 The Problem I started work as a software engineer about 7 months ago now. With many long hours sitting and staring at the screen, I realized that my hands and arms were hurting. I also noticed my eyes were hurting, but I resolved that by being more dedicated to following my Stretchly routines (every 20 minutes, start at something 20 ft away for 20 seconds and every hour, take a 2 minute walk).</description>

      <title>Migrating to Hugo</title>

      <description>This is my first post using Hugo, a static site generator, with the PaperMod theme. I migrated from a self-built Svelte-Kit based JAMStack. This gave me an opportunity to use a simpler to manage stack of getting content out there. I got to dip my toes into the world of a front-end web developer.
Why did I switch? I quickly learned front-end is not for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an eye for colors and style.</description>

      <description>This a quick opinionated guide towards encoding your videos for your data hoarding habits. HandBrake is an open-source tool that is widely used by many to convert videos. It is available on Windows/macOS/Linux, so chances are you can use it. HandBrake itself is mostly an easy to use GUI that call various audio and video codecs so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn how to use those individual (mostly command-line) tools. This is an article for people in a hurry so let&amp;rsquo;s get going!</description>

      <title>Legitimacy of the Supreme Court</title>

      <description>I love the Supreme Court. I got to see the building last fall. I have read &amp;ldquo;The Nine&amp;rdquo; by Jeffrey Toobin. As a liberal, I love RBG. I love the little snippets of quip and oration from the Justices and the lawyers who need to argue before them. I am not a lawyer, but maybe in another universe, I could have been.
Things I do not love: the downfall of the past few years.</description>

      <title>Reader to Creator and Execution</title>

      <description>I keep talking and thinking about how I can reach a creator state. It turns out, I am the biggest blocker for reaching that creator state (no surprises there). Self-doubt, imposter syndrome, a fear of putting myself out there are all reasons I have been afraid to push more content. Does anyone care? Who cares? I am doing this for me. To push myself beyond what I am comfortable and capable of right now.</description>

      <title>Top 20 of 2021</title>

      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/top-20-of-2021/</guid>
      <description>Here are my top 20 things (besides my wife and buns of course) from 2021. This list is by no means perfect or comprehensive and in no particular order, but things that managed to make it past all the self-filtering at this point in time.
Vaccines - Obviously, we cannot talk about 2021 without talking about the elephant in the room, COVID-19. After a year of saying &amp;ldquo;after everything that&amp;rsquo;s happened,&amp;rdquo; we (as humans) can now give a giant screw you to COVID.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;DO YouR OwN resEarCH&amp;rdquo; as they say since the start of the pandemic. I have been. My #1 source for all COVID-19 related news has been from The New York Times. I remember throughout the early pandemic, I was doing research all day while I worked from home. I was learning all sorts of things about epidemiology, viruses, pandemics, you name it. It felt amazing to be learning all this stuff.</description>

      <title>Tweets Collected Part 1</title>

      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/tweets-collected-part-1/</guid>
      <description>I am going to start a collection of what would be Tweets or Twitlongers. All of these will be thoughts too poorly thought out to be it&amp;rsquo;s own post, but too long to be a tweet. Every numbered section would have been a its own Tweet or Twitlonger
#1: I think I have something against Twitter. I use it to semi-promote this blog to a very small audience. 18 followers as of this writing.</description>
