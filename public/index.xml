      <title>Gamedev Log October 2023</title>

      <description>October was a fairly sparse month for game development. I got a little burned out of aimlessly coding. I was working on breakout in pygame using an Entity-Component-System.
I started work as a software engineer which has really consumed a lot of my programming energy.
I started doing game development again this month. I have chosen to use pygame-ce as my framework so that I can work in Python. When I last started in 2020, I had chosen the Love2D framework which used Lua as the programming language.</description>

      <description>I started doing game development again this month. I have chosen to use pygame-ce as my framework so that I can work in Python. When I last started in 2020, I had chosen the Love2D framework which used Lua as the programming language. My original thoughts were that I gave up on gamedev because I was working in a language that would never be used outside of programming. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough in Lua itself to keep me fully interested in it, so I abandoned it.</description>

      <title>Video Encoding for People in a Hurry</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/video-encoding-for-people-in-a-hurry/</link>

      <description>This a quick opinionated guide towards encoding your videos for your data hoarding habits. HandBrake is an open-source tool that is widely used by many to convert videos. It is available on Windows/macOS/Linux, so chances are you can use it. HandBrake itself is mostly an easy to use GUI that call various audio and video codecs so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn how to use those individual (mostly command-line) tools. This is an article for people in a hurry so let&amp;rsquo;s get going!</description>

      <title>How I Made This Site (2023 Edition)</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/how-i-made-this-site-2023/</link>

      <description>Despite how long this site has been up, I actually started in March 2023. This is not an explicit tutorial, but you could probably follow along and get through building your own similar site if you wanted.
My goal of this guide is to give you the exact steps on how to build this site. My goal is to explain a little bit about what I know of the web (which I am not an expert by a longshot) and the design decisions I made to build this in 2023.</description>

      <title>Legitimacy of the Supreme Court</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/legitimacy-of-the-supreme-court/</link>

      <description>I love the Supreme Court. I got to see the building last fall. I have read &amp;ldquo;The Nine&amp;rdquo; by Jeffrey Toobin. As a liberal, I love RBG. I love the little snippets of quip and oration from the Justices and the lawyers who need to argue before them. I am not a lawyer, but maybe in another universe, I could have been.
Things I do not love: the downfall of the past few years.</description>

      <title>Reader to Creator and Execution</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/reader-to-creator-and-execution/</link>

      <description>I keep talking and thinking about how I can reach a creator state. It turns out, I am the biggest blocker for reaching that creator state (no surprises there). Self-doubt, imposter syndrome, a fear of putting myself out there are all reasons I have been afraid to push more content. Does anyone care? Who cares? I am doing this for me. To push myself beyond what I am comfortable and capable of right now.</description>

      <title>Top 20 of 2021</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/top-20-of-2021/</link>

      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/top-20-of-2021/</guid>
      <description>Here are my top 20 things (besides my wife and buns of course) from 2021. This list is by no means perfect or comprehensive and in no particular order, but things that managed to make it past all the self-filtering at this point in time.
Vaccines - Obviously, we cannot talk about 2021 without talking about the elephant in the room, COVID-19. After a year of saying &amp;ldquo;after everything that&amp;rsquo;s happened,&amp;rdquo; we (as humans) can now give a giant screw you to COVID.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;DO YouR OwN resEarCH&amp;rdquo; as they say since the start of the pandemic. I have been. My #1 source for all COVID-19 related news has been from The New York Times. I remember throughout the early pandemic, I was doing research all day while I worked from home. I was learning all sorts of things about epidemiology, viruses, pandemics, you name it. It felt amazing to be learning all this stuff.</description>

      <title>Tweets Collected Part 1</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/tweets-collected-part-1/</link>

      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/tweets-collected-part-1/</guid>
      <description>I am going to start a collection of what would be Tweets or Twitlongers. All of these will be thoughts too poorly thought out to be it&amp;rsquo;s own post, but too long to be a tweet. Every numbered section would have been a its own Tweet or Twitlonger
#1: I think I have something against Twitter. I use it to semi-promote this blog to a very small audience. 18 followers as of this writing.</description>

      <title>Goals</title>

      <description>I have a few different goals with this blog.
1. Improve my writing skills. (Realistic) This is the number one goal. How am I doing this? By writing a lot. This post will come up just one day after my intro post. I don&amp;rsquo;t have plans to necessarily write everyday, but I will ride whatever wave comes my way. For now, I think every day is sustainable as I am currently on winter break from my MBA classes at West Texas A&amp;amp;M University.</description>

      <title>What is This?</title>
      <link>https://solivan.dev/blog/what-is-this/</link>

      <guid>https://solivan.dev/blog/what-is-this/</guid>
      <description>What is the purpose of this website? The combination of the URL &amp;amp; blog name, the sidebar description and this nobody writer all reveal nothing about what this place is. I think the best way to summarize really what this site is: this website is a personal blog which can vary from some common topics that I think about like politics and video games (development sometimes!) to macroeconomics and marriage all in the pursuit of &amp;ldquo;developing&amp;rdquo; better writing.</description>
